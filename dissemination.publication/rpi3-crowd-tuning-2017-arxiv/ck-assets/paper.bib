   architecture with a view to motivate the development of alternate
   inter-operation communication mechanism that reduce the bandwidth
   demanded of a centralized register file.  We first provide metrics to
   characterize the register traffic.  These metrics deal with the degree
   and locality of use of the register instances created. We then present
   the results of a simulation study that uses the MIPS R2000 architecture
   and the SPEC benchmark programs.  We have two major results. First, a
   large number of the register instances are used only once, and the
   average degree of use of register instances is about 2. Second, most of
   the register instances are used up soon after they are created (within
   30-40 instructions). This suggests that alternate inter-operation
   communication mechanisms that exploit the temporal locality of use of
   register instances are likely to be effective in reducing the traffic
   burden on the centralized register file. The second result was pivotal
   in the design of the distributed register file for the multiscalar
   processing paradigm.")

              on-chip cache memories which shows the dependence of the cache
              access time on the cache parameters. This model includes not only
              general cache parameters such as cache size(C), block size(B) and
              associativity (A), but also array configuration parameters (Ndwl,
              Ndbl, Ntwl and Ntbl) that are responsible for determining the
              subarray aspect ratio and the number of subarrays. This model
              makes it possible to quickly evaluate the cahe speed using three
              major cache parameters and the physical RAN array organization
              parameters without concrete circuit design. A large cache design
              space can be covered which cannot be done by only SPICE circuit
              simulation within a limited time. Using the model, the following
              results re obtained: 1) for given C,B and A, optimum array
              configuration parameters can be used to minimize the access time;
              2) if the optimum array parameters are used, then the optimum
              access time is roughly proportional to the log(cache size); and 3)
              when the optimum array parameters are used, larger block size give
              smaller access time but larger associativity does not give smaller
              access time because of the increase of the data-bus capacitances."

abstract ={Computational properties of use of biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

    abstract = {{Empirical auto-tuning and machine learning techniques have been showing high potential to improve execution time, power consumption, code size, reliability and other important metrics of various applications for more than two decades. However, they are still far from widespread production use due to lack of native support for auto-tuning in an ever changing and complex software and hardware stack, large and multi-dimensional optimization spaces, excessively long exploration times, and lack of unified mechanisms for preserving and sharing of optimization knowledge and research material. We present a possible collaborative approach to solve above problems using Collective Mind knowledge management system. In contrast with previous cTuning framework, this modular infrastructure allows to preserve and share through the Internet the whole auto-tuning setups with all related artifacts and their software and hardware dependencies besides just performance data. It also allows to gradually structure, systematize and describe all available research material including tools, benchmarks, data sets, search strategies and machine learning models. Researchers can take advantage of shared components and data with extensible meta-description to quickly and collaboratively validate and improve existing auto-tuning and benchmarking techniques or prototype new ones. The community can now gradually learn and improve complex behavior of all existing computer systems while exposing behavior anomalies or model mispredictions to an interdisciplinary community in a reproducible way for further analysis. We present several practical, collaborative and model-driven auto-tuning scenarios. We also decided to release all material at http://c-mind.org/repo to set up an example for a collaborative and reproducible research as well as our new publication model in computer engineering where experimental results are continuously shared and validated by the community.}},

The extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant on the show, not merely a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of QA.}},

  abstract={The enormous and growing complexity of today's high-end systems has increased the already significant challenges of obtaining high performance on equally complex scientific applications. Application scientists are faced with a daunting challenge in tuning their codes to exploit performance-enhancing architectural features. The Performance Engineering Research Institute (PERI) is working toward the goal of automating portions of the performance tuning process. This paper describes PERI's overall strategy for auto-tuning tools and recent progress in both building auto-tuning tools and demonstrating their success on kernels, some taken from large-scale applications.}

 abstractNote={Optimization results to demonstrate compiler autotuning, crowd-tuning and machine learning on RPi3 via customizable Collective Knowledge workflow framework with a portable package manager.

   These results in the Collective Knowledge format help prototype a common and reproducible optimization methodology to support Artifact evaluation and Pareto-efficient co-design competitions of the whole software and hardware stack for emerging workloads such as deep learning in terms of speed, accuracy, energy and costs:
